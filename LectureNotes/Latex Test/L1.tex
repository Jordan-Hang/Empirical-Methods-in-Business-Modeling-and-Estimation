\title{Notes on Empirical Methods in Business \\ Lecture 0: Introduction}

\section{Introduction}
During the first year of my PhD, I have taken a course on Empirical Methods in Business: Modeling and Estimation. 
This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the most commonly used empirical methods in business research. The main topics of the course can be seen in section 3. 
I mainly used handwritten notes when I was taking the lectures, which is hard to formalize. As a PhD researcher specializing in empirical studies, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of common empirical methods.
Therefore, I review the course content and summarize it in a more formal way to help others who are interested in empirical methods in business research.

Worth to mention that, all the faults in the notes are mine, and I will try my best to make it accurate and clear. If you find any mistakes or have any suggestions, please feel free to contact me.


\section{Research Classification}

Traditional classifications in empirical research:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Controlled data: Lab, AFE, FFE
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Field experiment: AFE (artefactual field experiment), FFE (framed field experiment)
        \item Lab experiment
    \end{itemize}
    \item Naturally occurring / observational data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Natural experiment: NE, NFE (natural field experiment\footnote{Field experiment that happens naturally, and people do not realize the experiment they are in.})
        \item Market data: IV, PSM, STR (Structural modeling)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Identify the \underline{causal treatment effects} has been the main focus of empirical research in business.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The golden rule for identification: \textbf{Randomization of treatment status}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $y_i = \alpha + \gamma T_i + \epsilon_i$, where $T_i$ is the treatment status.
        \item Randomization makes $E(\epsilon_i | T_i = 0) = E(\epsilon_i | T_i = 1)$
        \item Thus, $\gamma$ can identify the causal effect of treatment.
    \end{itemize}
        \item No endogenous issues: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item People cannot quit or switch the groups;
        \item No spillover effect:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Across sides: two-sided platform, sellers and buyers switch -- no reverse causality;
            \item Across groups in one side: individuals in each group do not aware they are treated or controlled. i.e., no information spillovers.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Market data cannot be randomized, so we need to use other methods to identify the causal effect of treatment:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Statistical methods: Approximating the experiments: e.g., DiD
    \item Econometric methods:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Control methods
        \item Instrument variables
        \item Structural models
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Many researchers focus more on fancy methods, ignoring the data and assumptions, making the story less reliable. Questions need to think before digging into the research:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the data? Can it help identify the causal effects?
    \item What are the identification assumptions? Are they reasonable?
\end{itemize}

4 key components in empirical research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Research Questions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Why are your research questions important?
        \item What is the use for business/consumers/regulators?
        \item What is your contribution to the literature?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Data}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can your data help address your research questions?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Model}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What is \(Y\)? What are your \(X\)'s?
        \item What is the relationship between \(Y\) and \(X\)'s?
        \item What is the data generating process (DGP)?
        \item How does your model address your research questions?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Estimation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item OLS / NLS? MLE? Method of moments? Other more advanced methods?
        \item What is the identification of model parameters?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In the main content of this note, I will focus more on modeling and estimation part. 
Given the research question and data, how to build up the model, what are potential issues of the model, and how to estimate the parameters are the interests.
