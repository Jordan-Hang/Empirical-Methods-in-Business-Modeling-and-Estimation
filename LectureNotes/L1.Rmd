# Introduction to Experiments

## Field Experiment
- Field Experiment and Natural Experiment
- Control Variables: Price, Sales

# Identifying Causal Effects

## Necessary Conditions for Experiments
- Golden Rule: Randomization of Treatment Status
  - Everyone has the same probability to be treated or controlled
- No endogenous attrition or selection issue
- No spillover effects across groups

# Statistical Methods for Inferring Causality

## Data Considerations
- Data cannot be randomized
- Econometric Methods: Fixed Effects, Instrumental Variables
- Importance of identifying assumptions and verifying their reasonableness

## Research Questions and Data
1. Research Questions: Why is it important?
2. Data: Can the data help address the research questions?
3. Model: Data generating process (relationship between Y and X)
4. Estimation: Methods for identification

# Empirical Analysis

## Linear Regression Model
- Model: \( Y = X\beta + \epsilon \)
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Estimator
  - \( \hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'Y \)
  - Conditions: No perfect multicollinearity, errors have zero mean

## Complementarity and Substitutability
- Complementarity: Implementation of one practice increases the marginal return to other practices
- Substitutability: Implementation of one practice decreases the marginal return to other practices

# Example: Olympic Games Analysis

## Research Question
- How do population and GDP per capita affect the number of medals won by a country?

## Model Specification
- Model 1: \( \text{Medals}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Population}_i + \beta_2 \text{GDP per capita}_i + \epsilon_i \)
  - Control for competition level and other factors
- Model 2: \( \text{Medals}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Population}_i + \beta_2 \text{GDP per capita}_i + \beta_3 (\text{Competition})_i + \epsilon_i \)

# Mixed Effects Model

- Captures the total effect of competition
- Example: \( T_i = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{Population}_i + \beta_2 \text{GDP per capita}_i + \epsilon_i \)

# Prediction and Model Validation

## Predictions
- Example: Predict medals based on the model
- Use known values for Population and GDP per capita to estimate future medals

## Equation Solving
- Solving the equation systems to get predictions

# Conclusion

- Summary of key points
- Importance of considering assumptions in econometric models
