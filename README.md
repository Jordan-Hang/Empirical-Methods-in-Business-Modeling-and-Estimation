# Empirical-Methods-in-Business-Modeling-and-Estimation

## The Purpose of This Note

- During the first year of my PhD, I have taken a course on Empirical Methods in Business: Modeling and Estimation taught by Prof. Tat Chan from WUSTL. This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the most commonly used empirical methods in business research. The main topics of the course can be seen in section 3. 

- I mainly used handwritten notes when I was taking the lectures, which is hard to formalize. As a PhD researcher specializing in empirical studies, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of common empirical methods. Therefore, I review the course content and summarize it in a more formal way to help others who are interested in empirical methods in business research.

- Worth to mention that, my notes are mainly based on what prof. Tat Chan's lecture notes, **but all the faults in this notes are mine**. I will try my best to make it accurate and clear. If you find any mistakes or have any suggestions, please feel free to contact me.
